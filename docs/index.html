  <h1 id="title">The Problem</h1>
  
  <div id="content1">
	<p> The problem is a machine learning competition hosted by <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/bike-sharing-demand">Kaggle</a>.</p>
	<p>In this project, we aim to predict the count of bike rentals for a city-wide bikeshare system in
		Washington DC, using the data collected by the Capital Bike Share Program. Bike rental service
		has been encouraged an alternative way to provide convenient access to vehicles for a short
		period of time and in an environment-friendly way. A common issue bothering bike rental shops
		or bike sharing systems is how to predict rental demand, which is essential to the operation of
		such kind of business. 
	</p>
	<p> An accurate prediction on the demand could be used to solve the following problems:  
		<li>How to balance the cost and efficiency by locating the right number of bikes at the right time; </li> 
		<li>How to setup specific market strategy to increase demand at particular
		days or time slots</li> 
	<p>In addition, the prediction results would serve as a reference of price adjustment by taking the significant factors into considerations, such as weather, holidays,
		weekend etc.</p>	
	
	<h3>Dataset</h2>
	<p>The dataset combined bike sharing data collected by the Capital Bike Share program and the weather data in Washington D.C. It has the hourly rental data spanning two years from 1/1/2011 to 12/31/2012. The training set is comprised of the first 19 days of each month, while the test set is the 20th to the end of the month. To predict the total count of bikes rented during each hour covered by the test set, only information available prior to the rental period can be used.</p>
	<p></p>
 </div>

   <div id="content2">
	 <p>In the exploratory analysis, we asked following questions:
		<li> How is the count of bike rental associated with the day of the week? </li>
			<img src="pic/dayofweek.png", alt="Bike Demand in Day of Week"><br>
		<p>  An interesting pattern was displayed that for the weekday 0 to 4, which represent Monday to Friday, the peaks of bike rental occurred at 8 and 17 oâ€™clock, while for the weekday 5 and 6, which represent the weekend, the peaks of bike rental occurred at the noon. </p>

		<br><li> How the hourly count of bike rental changes in different seasons? </li>
			<img src="pic/season.png", alt="Bike Demand in seasons"><br>
		<p> The pattern of hourly bike rental is consistent throughout the seasons, but obviously in spring, the total count is lowered than the other seasons</p>
		
		<br><li> How is the bike demand impacted by holiday, weekends and weekdays?</li>
			<img src="pic/holiday.png", alt="Bike Demand in holiday, weekends and weekdays"> <br>
		<p>Although the average count of bike rental is pretty closed among holiday, weekends and weekdays, but there are more outliers in weekdays.</p>

		<br><li>Do registered users rented bike more often than casual (non-registered) users</li>
			<img src="pic/users.png", alt="casual and registered users">
		<p> Registered users maintained a higher count of rental bike, especially in the peak hours (8 and 17 o'clock). However, casual users displayed a different pattern in that not only did they rent much less in total, but also they usually rented bikes between 12 to16.</p>

<div id="content3">
	<p>After doing the exploratory analysis, we took following steps to tackle down the problem:</p>
	<ol>
	<li>Feature Engineering. We created new features based on the datetime column and dropped highly correlated features.</li>
	<br>
	<li>Data Split. The data was splitted into training set (70%) and validation set (30%).</li>
	<br>
	<li>Model Selections. We opted for four predictive models. For each model we used the training set to tune the parameters to achieve the lowest rmlse (Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error). The performance of the four models was then compared with the validation set.</li>
	<br>
	<li>Prediction. With the model that yielded the greatest performance with the validation set, we predicted the hourly bike rental count in the test data.</li>
	</ol>


</div>

	<div id="content4">
	<h4>Generalized Linear Regression</h4>
	<p>Considering the values of response variables are positive, we tried two generalized linear models: Poission Regression and Negative Binomial Regression. The latter yielded a lower rmlse, and gave the rmlse score of 1.16 on the validation dataset. </p>
	<img src="pic/glm.png">
	<h4>Random Forest</h4>
	<p>The model selection on Random Forest was based on five parameters including the number of trees. The optimized Random Forest gave us a rmlse around 0.35.</p>
	<img src="pic/RandomForest.png">
	<h4>Gradient Boost</h4>
	<p>As a strong competitor of Random Forest, Gradient Boost is another method of choice. In this problem, gradient boosted trees gave us the rmlse score of 0.4125,  a result closed to the Random Forest</p>
	<img src="pic/gbr.PNG">
	<h4>XGBoost</h4>
	<p>Finally, we tried a recently dominating model, the XGBoost. With this model, we achieved the lowest rmlse score of 0.30.</p>
