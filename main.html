  <div id="content1">
	<p> Bike sharing systems are a means of renting bicycles where the process of obtaining membership, rental, and bike return is automated via a network of kiosk locations throughout a city. Using these systems, people are able rent a bike from a one location and return it to a different place on an as-needed basis. Currently, there are over 500 bike-sharing programs around the world.
	<p>
	<p>
	The data generated by these systems makes them attractive for researchers because the duration of travel, departure location, arrival location, and time elapsed is explicitly recorded. Bike sharing systems therefore function as a sensor network, which can be used for studying mobility in a city. In this competition, participants are asked to combine historical usage patterns with weather data in order to forecast bike rental demand in the Capital Bikeshare program in Washington, D.C.

	</p>
	
 </div>

   <div id="content2">
	 <p>We began by conducting exploratory analysis on the bike rental data. We were provided with bike rentals per hour (shared across 'casual' and 'registered' users) along with a number of features associated with that hour. A number of trends were immediately apparent and suggested that certain features would be strong predictors. 
	 </p>

	<p>We observe that 'registered' users show a strong bimodal distribution with hour of the day, as they probably use their bike to travel to and from work. On the hand, this is not observed for the 'casual' users whose usage peaks in the middle of the day. Also we can see an increase in bike usage from the 'casual' users at the weekend compared to the week and an oppositive behaviour from the 'registered' users.
